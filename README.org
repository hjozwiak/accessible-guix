#+TITLE: Accessible Guix Images for Blind/visually Impaired Persons
#+AUTHOR: Hunter Jozwiak

* Project Goals
Since learning about Guix, I have wanted to make an ISO image that has a graphical interface and screenreaders enabled by default. And so this project was born.
** Goals
The project has the following goals:
- Remain as minimal as possible: the aim is to provide an accessible interface, not necessariy to have a full on live environment.
- Support various environment.
- Possibly port Fenrir and/or Espeakup to Guix for a truly minimal, command line interface.
* Environments
To the best of my knowledge, the following interfaces have good accessibility support and will have images available.
- GNOME
- MATE
- Ratpoison with the [[https:git.2mb.codes/~stormdragon2976/strychnine][Strychnine plugin]]
- Possibly Stumpwm.
